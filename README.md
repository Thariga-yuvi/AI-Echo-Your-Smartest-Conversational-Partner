📘 Sentiment Analysis NLP Project
A simple NLP model that classifies text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and NLP preprocessing techniques.
🚀 Features
Preprocesses raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Trains a Logistic Regression / Naïve Bayes / ML model for classification.
Interactive app (app.py) to test custom text inputs.
Jupyter Notebook (nlp.ipynb) for end-to-end training and analysis.
Well-structured project with modular code and datasets.
